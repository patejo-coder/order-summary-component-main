## My process

To start the project, as usual I started by defining each element of the page and from there I started with CSS to style and start delivering the appearance that the site should have.

In CSS, use Display: Flex to position the elements in a more flexible way across the page and then simply style them according to the instructions provided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS: Background-Image, Background-Repeat and Other;
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to better use the background property, I improved the use of Grid together with Flexbox.
And I also started using CSS to introduce images that are more aesthetic than relevant to the site.
